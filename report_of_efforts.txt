Setting up VMs manually with virtual box is a time consuming process.
In addition to having to manually configure many steps, including selecting ISO, to establishing the size of disk, memory, and cpu to provision.
Ubuntu then requires running in 'install mode' which takes a lot of time and requires manual steps to keep processing.
Afterwards, additional steps are requires to update the system and then restart.

Doing this over and over again would definitely be time consuming.

Provisioning the cloud instances was as bit easier: 
There were fewer steps, mostly limited to selecting the ISO/image, a flavor, and then network configuration including security groups, IP, and key assignment.
Although there were fewer steps and it did seem to run quickly, this could be tedious if managing hundreds or even thousands of instances.

Configuring kafka and getting the cluster to initially work was probably one of the hardest parts.
In addition to having to research and figure out that IPv4 had to be configured manually, there was trial and error getting the server.properties files just right.
Once those obstacles were overcome, actually deploying the console consumer/producer working was very rewarding.

Pretty comfortable navigating with CLI and using Bash and linux, so those aspects weren't too bad, but still required a lot of manual steps such as grabbing/running them properly/as needed.
